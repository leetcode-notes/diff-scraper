<h1>Homework 6. Containerization support languages</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Following up on <a href='pr.html'>the project</a>, suppose you are
trying to run a Twisted Places proxy herd on a large set of virtual
machines. To keep costs low, you decide to standardize on Linux
kernels and use operating system-level virtualization
with <a href='https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/'>Linux Containers</a>
(LXC). To manage your deployment, you'd like to
use <a href='https://www.docker.com/'>Docker</a>.</p>

<p>Your boss is a bit worried about Docker, partly because it's so
new, and partly because there is a single source for it&mdash;if the
main version of Docker is buggy, you'll be toast. She wonders whether
it'd be feasible to come up with a separate implementation for Docker,
one written in a completely different programming language, so that
your team will have the freedom to choose either the standard
implementation or the alternative one (let's call it DockAlt), and
switch to the alternative if problems crop up in the standard one.</p>

<p>Docker is implemented using the <a href='https://golang.org/'>Go</a>
programming language, and its developers have explained why they chose
Go in their talk <a
href='http://www.slideshare.net/jpetazzo/docker-and-go-why-did-we-decide-to-write-docker-in-go'>Docker:
an insider view</a>.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Review the insider-view talk, and consider three other languages
that are plausible candidates for implementing DockAlt: (1) Java, (2)
OCaml, and (3) a language taken from the following list.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://elixir-lang.org/'>Elixir</a></li>
<li><a href='https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/'>Rust</a></li>
<li><a href='https://www.scala-lang.org/'>Scala</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Do some research on your three languages and support software as a
potential platform for DockAlt. Your research should include an
examination of the language and system documentation to help determine
whether it would be an effective way to implement DockAlt.</p>

<p>Unlike the project, we are not expecting working prototypes, though
prototypes are welcome.</p>

<p>Write an executive summary that compares the three alternate
approaches to each other and to Docker. The
summary should be in 10-point font or larger and should be at most
three pages. You can put references and appendixes in later pages, if
there's not enough room on four pages: the appendixes should contain
any source code or diagrams. Your summary should focus on the
technologies' effects on ease of use, flexibility, generality,
performance, reliability; thie idea is to explore the most-important
technical challenges in doing the proposed rewrite. The summary should
be suitable for software executives, that is, for readers who have
some expertise in software, particularly in managing software
developers, but who are not experts in Java or OCaml or your chosen
language. Please keep the <a href='../comm.html'>resources for written
reports and oral presentations</a> in mind, particularly its rubrics
and its advice for citations to sources that you consulted.</p>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit a file <samp>hw6.pdf</samp> containing your summary. If you
have prototype code, submit it as a compressed
tarball <samp>hw6.tar.gz</samp> in the usual way; it should include a
README file that contains instructions for how to build and run the
prototype.</p>
