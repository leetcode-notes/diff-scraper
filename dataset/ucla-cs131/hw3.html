<h1>Homework 3. Java shared memory performance races</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>You're working for a startup company Ginormous Data Inc. (GDI) that
specializes in finding patterns in large amounts of data. For example,
a big retailer might give GDI all the web visits and purchases made
and all the credit reports they've inspected and records of all the
phone calls to them, and GDI will then find patterns in the data that
suggest which toys will be hot this Christmas season. The programs
that GDI writes are mostly written in Java. They aren't perfect;
they're just heuristics, and they're operating on incomplete and
sometimes-inaccurate information. They do need to be fast, though, as
your clients are trying to find patterns faster than their competition
can, and are willing to put up with a few errors even if the results
aren't perfect, so long as they get good-enough results quickly.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p> GDI regularly uses multithreading to speed up its applications,
and many of GDI's programs operate on shared-memory representations of
the state of a simulation. These states are updated safely, using
Java's <samp><a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/syncmeth.html'>synchronized</a></samp>
keyword, and this is known to be a bottleneck in the code. Your boss
asks you what will happen if you remove the <samp>synchronized</samp>
keyword. You reply, "It'll break the simulations." She responds, "So
what? If it's just a small amount of breakage, that might be good
enough.  Or maybe you can substitute some other synchronization
strategy that's less heavyweight, and <em>that</em>'ll be good
enough." She suggests that you look into this by measuring how often
GDI's programs are likely to break if they switch to
inadequate-but-faster synchronization methods.</p>

<p>In some sense this assignment is the reverse of what software
engineers traditionally do with multithreaded
applications. Traditionally, they are worried about race conditions
and insert enough synchronization so that the races become
impossible. Here, though, you're deliberately trying to add races to
the code in order to speed it up, and want to measure whether (and
ideally, how badly) things will break if you do.</p>

<p>It should be noted that we are on thin ice here, so thin that some
would argue we've gone over the edge. That's OK: we're experimenting!

<h2>The Java memory model</h2>

<p>Java synchronization is based on
the <a href='http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/'>Java
memory model</a> (JMM), which defines how an application can safely
avoid data races when accessing shared memory. The JMM lets Java
implementations optimize accesses by allowing more behaviors than the
intuitive semantics where there is a global clock and actions by
threads interleave in a schedule that assumes sequential
consistency. On modern hardware, these intuitive semantics are often
incorrect: for example, intraprocessor cache communication might be
faster than memory, which means that a cached read can return a new
value on one processor before an uncached read returns an old value on
another. To allow this kind of optimization, first, the JMM says that
two accesses to the same location <dfn>conflict</dfn> if they come
from different threads, at least one is a write, and the location is
not declared to be <samp><a
href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/atomic.html'>volatile</a></samp>;
and second, the JMM says that behavior is well-defined to be data-race
free (DRF) unless two conflicting accesses occur without
synchronization in between.</p>

<p>The details for proving that a program is DRF can be tricky, as is
optimizing a Java implementation with data-race freedom in mind. Not
only have serious memory-synchronization bugs been found in Java
implementations, occasionally bugs have been found in the JMM itself,
and sometimes people have even announced bugs only to find out later
that they weren't bugs after all. For more details about this, please

<h2>How to break sequential consistency in Java</h2>

<p>It's easy to write programs that break sequential consistency in Java.
To model
this, you will use a simple prototype that manages a data structure
that represents an array of integers. Each integer is in the range
[0,<em>maxval</em>] where <em>maxval</em> is at most 127, so the
integer can be represented by the Java type <samp>byte</samp>.  A
state transition, called a <dfn>swap</dfn>, consists of subtracting 1
from one of the positive integers in the array, and adding 1 to an
integer that is less than <em>maxval</em>. The sum of all the integers
should therefore
remain constant; if it varies, that indicates that one or more
transitions weren't done correctly. Also, the values in the array
should always be in range. The converse is not true: if the sum
remains constant and the values remain in range it's still possible
that some state transitions were done incorrectly. Still, these tests
are reasonable ways to check for errors in the simulation.</p>

<p>For an example of a simulation, see <a href='jmm.jar'
type='application/java-archive'>jmm.jar</a>,
a <a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/basicsindex.html'>JAR
file</a> containing the simplified source code of a simulation. It
contains the following interfaces and classes:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><samp>State</samp></dt>
 <dd>The API for a simulation state. The only way to change the state
   is to invoke <samp>swap(i,j)</samp>, where <samp>i</samp>
   and <samp>j</samp> are indexes into the array. If
   the <samp>i</samp>th entry in the array is positive
   and the <samp>j</samp>th entry is less than the maximum value allowed,
   the swap
   succeeds, subtracting 1 from the <samp>i</samp>th entry and adding 1 to
   the <samp>j</samp>th entry, returning <samp>true</samp>. Otherwise
   the swap fails and does nothing, returning <samp>false</samp>.</dd>

 <dt><samp>Nullstate</samp></dt>
 <dd>An implementation of <samp>State</samp> that does nothing.
   Swapping has no effect. This is used for timing the scaffolding
   of the simulation.</dd>

 <dt><samp>SynchronizedState</samp></dt>
 <dd>An implementation of <samp>State</samp> that uses the
   Synchronized class so that it is safe but slow.</dd>

 <dt><samp>SwapTest</samp></dt>
 <dd>A
   <samp><a
   href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html'>Runnable</a></samp>
   class that tests a state implementation by performing
   a given number of successful swaps on it. It does not count
   failed swaps.</dd>

 <dt><samp>UnsafeMemory</samp></dt>
 <dd>A test harness, with a <samp>main</samp> method. Invoke it via a
   shell command like "<samp>java UnsafeMemory Synchronized 8 1000000
   6 5 6 3 0 3</samp>". Here, Synchronized means to
   test the <samp>SynchronizedState</samp>
   implementation; <samp>8</samp> means to divide the work into 8
   threads of roughly equal size; <samp>1000000</samp> means to do a
   million successful swap transitions total; <samp>6</samp> is
   <em>maxval</em>, an integer in the range [0,127] as described above;
   and the remaining five
   numbers are the initial values for the five entries in the state
   array. The shell command outputs a string like "<samp>Threads
   average 3318.01 ns/transition</samp>", giving the approximate
   average number of real-time nanoseconds that it took a thread to do
   a successful swap, including all the overhead. It also outputs an
   error diagnostic if a reliability test fails.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Build and use a sequential-consistency-violating
performance and reliability testing program,
along the lines described below.</p>

<ul>

 <li>Your program should operate under Java Standard Edition 8. There
   is no need to run on older Java versions.</li>

 <li>Your program should compile cleanly, without any warnings.</li>

 <li>Please keep your implementation as simple and
   short as possible, for the benefit of the reader.</li>

 <li>Use the SEASnet GNU/Linux servers, with Java SE Development Kit
   8u112 or later (also known as Java version 1.8.0_112), to do your
   performance and reliability measurements. On SEASnet
   your <samp>PATH</samp> should be set to a string starting with
   "<samp>/usr/local/cs/bin</samp>:". </li>

 <li>Do not use more than 32 threads at a time,
   to avoid overloading the servers.</li>

 <li>Gather and report statistics about your testing platform, so that
   others can reproduce your results if they have similar
   hardware. See the output of <samp>java -version</samp>,
   and see the files <samp>/proc/cpuinfo</samp>
   and <samp>/proc/meminfo</samp>.</li>

 <li>Run the test harness on the <samp>Null</samp>
   and Synchronized classes, using various values for the
   number of threads, number of swap transitions, size of the
   state array, and sum of values in the state array, and characterize
   the performance of the two classes. Both classes should have 100%
   reliability, in the sense that they should pass all the tests
   (even though the <samp>Null</samp> class does not work); check this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do the following tasks and submit work that embodies your results.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Implement a new class Unsynchronized, which is
   implemented just like Synchronized except that it
   does not use the keyword <samp>synchronized</samp> in its
   implementation.</li>

 <li>Implement a new class GetNSet, which is halfway
   between unsynchronized and synchronized, in that it does not use
   synchronized code, but instead uses volatile accesses to array
   elements. Implement it with the <samp>get</samp>
   and <samp>set</samp> methods
   of <samp><a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicIntegerArray.html'>java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicIntegerArray</a></samp>.</li>

 <li>Design and implement a new class BetterSafe of
   your choice, which achieves better performance
   than Synchronized while retaining 100% reliability.</li>

 <li>Design and implement yet another new class BetterSorry of
   your choice, which achieves better performance
   than BetterSafe and better reliability
   than Unsynchronized.  However, BetterSorry should not be DRF.
   BetterSorry must still
   be <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock'>deadlock</a>-free,
   though; as its goal is improved performance, and deadlock
   yields <em>terrible</em> performance.  Try to make BetterSorry
   at least as good as GetNSet in all important respects,
   and better than GetNSet in some.</li>

 <li>Integrate all the classes into a single program
   <samp>UnsafeMemory</samp>, which you should be able to compile
   with the command <samp>javac UnsafeMemory.java</samp> and to run
   using the same sort of shell command as the test harness.</li>

 <li>For each
   class Synchronized, Unsynchronized, GetNSet, BetterSafe,
   and BetterSorry, measure and characterize the class's
   performance and reliability.</li>

 <li>Compare the classes' reliability and performance to each other.
   Does any class seem to be the best choice for GDI's applications?</li>
</ol>

<p>You may want to look at
<samp><a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html'>java.util.concurrent</a></samp>,
<samp><a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/package-summary.html'>java.util.concurrent.atomic</a></samp>
and
<samp><a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/package-summary.html'>java.util.concurrent.locks</a></samp>
for implementation ideas.</p>

<p>Write a report that contains the following explanations and
discussions.  Your report should be at least one and at most two pages
long, using 10-point font in a two-column format on an
8&frac12;"&times;11" page, as suggested in the USENIX template
mentioned in <a href='../comm.html'>Resources for written reports and
oral presentations</a>.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Explain why your BetterSafe implementation
   is faster than Synchronized and why it is still
   100% reliable.</li>

 <li>Explain why your BetterSorry implementation is
   faster than BetterSafe. Explain why it is more
   reliable than Unsynchronized, by describing race
   conditions that Unsynchronized is liable to
   but BetterSorry avoids. Give a race condition
   that BetterSorry still suffers from. Can you write
   a test program that causes this race condition to occur with high
   probability and thus to make BetterSorry fail? If so,
   please supply it (and you can reuse it to answer
   questions below); if not, explain why not.</li>

 <li>Discuss any problems you had to
   overcome to do your measurements properly. Explain whether and why
   the class is DRF; if it is not DRF give a reliability test (as a
   shell command "<samp>java UnsafeMemory <em>model</em> ...</samp>")
   that the class is extremely likely to fail on the SEASnet GNU/Linux
   servers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit two files:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A JAR file <samp>jmmplus.jar</samp> containing your
solution.  It should contain a copy of the files
in <samp>jmm.jar</samp>, possibly with modifications (though you
should attempt to minimize these modifications). It should also
    contain the source code to your new classes. Please limit
      your source-code lines to 80 characters or less.</li>
    <li> A PDF
file <samp>report.pdf</samp> containing your explanations,
discussions, and performance and reliability results.</li>
    </ol>

<p>Do not put your name or student-ID into your submissions.</p>
