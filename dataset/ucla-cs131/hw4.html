<h1>Homework 4. Morse code data recovery</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>You are working for the <a href='https://www.loc.gov'>Library of
Congress</a> and are helping to analyze some ancient audio recordings
of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code'>Morse code</a>
operators in action. Someone else has written a program
that takes the analog signals from these recordings and turns them
into a digital representation of signal-on/signal-off.</p>

<p>Morse code represents each letter using a string of <samp>.</samp> (dih)
and <samp>-</samp> (dah) symbols. At the signal level, 1 (a signal-on of
duration 1) represents dih, 111 (a signal-on of
duration 3) represents dah, 0 (a signal-off of
duration 1) separates dihs from dahs within a
letter, 000 (signal-off of duration 3) represents the boundary between
two letters, and 0000000 (signal-off of duration 7) represent the
space between words.</p>

<p>For example, if the message is <samp>MORSE CO</samp>, its Morse
code is <samp>-- --- .-. ... .</samp> followed by a word space
followed by <samp>-.-. ---</samp> and its signal representation
is
<samp>111011100011101110111000101110100010101000100000001110101110100011101110111</samp>; this last is the output of your colleague's program and
the input to your program.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the audio recordings are of poor quality, and their
low-level analysis sometimes produces instances of 11 (two adjacent 1s
only); these are errors, and the original signals could have been
either 1 or 111. Similarly, the input to your program sometimes
contains instances of 00, which could have been either 0 or 000 in the
original data; of 0000, which must have been 000; and of 00000, which
could be either 000 or 0000000. When the input is ambiguous, you need
to evaluate either possibility, though you'll prefer to guess the
shorter alternative first. You should treat any sequence of more than
five 0s as if it were 0000000, and any sequence of more than three 1s
as if it were 111.</p>

<p>For example, if the input is <samp>11100111001111</samp> you want to
first guess that the actual data were <samp>11101110111</samp>; if
this doesn't work you'll then fall back on <samp>1110111000111</samp>,
<samp>1110001110111</samp>, and <samp>111000111000111</samp>,
respectively.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>First, write a Prolog predicate <samp>signal_morse/2</samp> that converts
a list of 1s and 0s to the corresponding list of <samp>.</samp>s,
<samp>-</samp>s, <samp>^</samp>s, and <samp>#</samp>s. For example, the goal:</p>

<pre><samp>?- signal_morse(
     [1,1,1,0,1,1,1,
      0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,
      0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
      1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,
      0,1,1,1],
     M).
</samp></pre>

<p>should succeed with:</p>

<pre><samp>M = [-,-,^,-,-,-,^,'.',-,'.',^,'.','.','.',^,'.',#,-,'.',-,'.',^,-,-,-]
</samp></pre>

<p>Here <samp>-</samp> and <samp>.</samp> stand for themselves;
<samp>^</samp> stands for a boundary between letters, and
<samp>#</samp> stands for a space between words. In this
representation, a word is any nonempty sequence of tokens other
than <samp>#</samp>.  (The GNU Prolog interpreter prints the
atom <samp>.</samp> as <samp>'.'</samp>.)</p>

<p>If <samp>signal_morse/2</samp> gets an ambiguous signal list, it
should generate all possible solutions, preferring solutions with
shorter leftmost alternatives, as described above.</p>

<p>Second, write a Prolog predicate <samp>signal_message/2</samp>
that converts a list of 1s and 0s to the corresponding list of
letters, interpreted according to the following Morse code table,
derived from <a

</samp></pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><samp>?- signal_message(
     [1,1,1,0,1,1,1,
      0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,
      0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
      1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,
      0,1,1,1],
     M).
</samp></pre>

<p>should succeed with:</p>

<pre><samp>M = [m,o,r,s,e,#,c,o]
</samp></pre>

<p>Again, <samp>#</samp> stands for the space between words, but there
is no <samp>^</samp> at this level because the boundary between
letters is understood.</p>

<p>If the signal contains noise, <samp>signal_message/2</samp> should
backtrack among all possible messages that it can stand for,
interpreted according to the above-mentioned disambiguation rules for
noisy signals. However, <samp>signal_message/2</samp> should succeed
only for disambiguated signals that correspond to a valid Morse code
message.</p>

<p>As a special case, if your <samp>signal_message/2</samp>
implementation finds a word, followed by zero or more spaces, followed
by an <samp>error</samp> token, it should omit the word, the spaces,
and the error token; it should then start scanning again after the
omitted tokens, looking for further errors. For example:</p>

<pre><samp>?- signal_message(
     [1,1,1,0,1,1,1, % m
      0,0,0,
      1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1, % o
      0,0,0,
      1,0,1,1,1,0,1, % r
      0,0,0,
      1,0,1,0,1, % s
      0,0,0,
      1, % e
      0,0,0,0,0,0,0, % #
      1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1, % c
      0,0,0,
      1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1, % o
      0,0,0,
      1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1, % error
      0,0,0,
      1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1, % error
      0,0,0,
      1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1, % error
      0,0,0,
      1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0 % as
     ],
     M).
</samp></pre>

<p>should succeed with <samp>M=[m,o,r,s,e,#,error,error,as]</samp>, because
the partial word 'CO' was erased by the first error token. The later
error tokens were not preceded by a word and optional spaces, so they are
preserved in the output.</p>

<p>Your implementations of <samp>signal_morse/2</samp> and
<samp>signal_message/2</samp> may assume that their first arguments
are <dfn><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_term'>ground
terms</a></dfn>, that is, terms that contain no logical variables.</p>

<p>Your implementation should run on <a href='http://www.gprolog.org/'>GNU
Prolog</a> 1.4.4 as installed on the SEASnet RHEL 7 hosts
as <samp>gprolog</samp> in <samp>/usr/local/cs/bin</samp>.</p>
